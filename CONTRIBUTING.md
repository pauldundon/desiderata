Desiderata is still at a very early stage (not even yet at proof-of-concept), but contributions are welcome, especially:

1.	Comments on the overall aims of the project, and in particular, whether it is likely to evolve into something useful (or at least interesting) and to what extent it duplicates or complements other projects
2.	Comments on the overall conceptual approach of the project. This is expressed in the development roadmap but also in some other wiki articles; all of these are, at this point, me shamelessly thinking out loud, so any comments at all are welcome.
3.	Comments on how the project interacts with existing standards (eg JSON Schema, link relationships)
4.	Comments on the development roadmap
5.	Help making the project easier to engage with, particularly making it easy to build the sources and experiment with the code. Testing the build procedure on a variety of platforms would help a lot.
6.	Help with porting the code to Node.js
